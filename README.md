# Wakeup-Word
It's just a simple Wakeup Word with great accuracy. The audio data are collected by using sounddevice framework. Librosa has been used to preprocess and extraxct the mfcc (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient) features from the audio collected. The data is then fed to the Neural Network for training. We need a mic in order to provide best accuracy.
